This project implements an intelligent game-playing agent for the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using Java.
The game is played between a human player (X) and an AI agent (O).
The AI uses the Minimax algorithm, a fundamental Artificial Intelligence technique, to always make the optimal move.
The objective of this project is to demonstrate how Artificial Intelligence decision-making algorithms can be applied to a simple game environment to create an unbeatable AI agent.
